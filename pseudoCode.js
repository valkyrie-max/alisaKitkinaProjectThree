//          â€¢ questions have five options to choose from, thus providing enough data for further calculation;
// 4.   Create a function that prevents the user from leaving the questions blank and still getting the result;

//          â€¢ else (proceed to the next question);
// 5.   Save the values from the inputs into variables;
// 6.   Use collected values to get a single anime title; 
//          â€¢ create a variable to calculate the score; 
// 7.   Display and provide the result to the user by dynamically adding HTML to the DOM;
//          â€¢ the result may include:
//                  â€“ name of the series/movie;
//                  â€“ short synopsis; 
//                  â€“ an image/gif from the said anime/movie; 
//                  â€“ link to watch it
// 8. After the result has been provided, allow the user to click another button in order to retake the quiz, should that be their desire;
