                <h2>“Anime”?</h2>
                <h3>What the hell is that?</h3>
                <p>Glad you asked! According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anime">the website that shall remain unnamed</a>, anime is animation originating from or associated with Japan. There are heated debates about whether anime is for kids or not. However, anime has a large age demographic that aims not only at children but adults as well. Therefore, on one hand, it can allow itself to discover dark topics such as death, war, bullying, jealousy and etc. on a deeper level. On the other hand, anime also can be used as a colorful visual medium, since there are shows that have children as their main intended audience. Hence, it can be used to teach kids to understand different types of people or the importance of hard work and dedication.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, anime remains very entertaining since for many reasons that vary from person to person. To some it's the symbolism and hidden meanings. To others it's the comedic aspect of the show. Meanwhile, there are people (like the creator of this quiz!) that enjoy the visuals, music, and action provided by a number of shows.</p>
